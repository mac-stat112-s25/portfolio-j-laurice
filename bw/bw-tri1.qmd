title: "Trivariate Viz Best Work"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)

# Using diamonds dataset from ggplot2
data("diamonds")
```

```{r}
# Initial Plot: Price, Carat, and Clarity (facet by clarity)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 1.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ clarity) +
  labs(title = "Diamond Price vs. Carat by Clarity and Cut",
       x = "Carat",
       y = "Price (USD)",
       color = "Cut") +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE)
```
