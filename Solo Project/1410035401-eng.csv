Footnotes:
1,"To ensure respondent confidentiality, estimates below a certain threshold are suppressed. For Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia suppression is applied to all data below 1,500. The threshold level for Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan is 500, while in Prince Edward Island, estimates under 200 are supressed. For census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and economic regions (ERs), use their respective provincial suppression levels mentioned above. Estimates are based on smaller sample sizes the more detailed the table becomes, which could result in lower data quality."
2,"All regions are based on the 1996 Census boundaries, with the exception of those in Prince Edward Island and in the territories, which respect the 2011 Census boundaries."
3,"Fluctuations in economic time series are caused by seasonal, cyclical and irregular movements. A seasonally adjusted series is one from which seasonal movements have been eliminated. Seasonal movements are defined as those which are caused by regular annual events such as climate, holidays, vacation periods and cycles related to crops, production and retail sales associated with Christmas and Easter. It should be noted that the seasonally adjusted series contain irregular as well as longer-term cyclical fluctuations. The seasonal adjustment program is a complicated computer program which differentiates between these seasonal, cyclical and irregular movements in a series over a number of years and, on the basis of past movements, estimates appropriate seasonal factors for current data. On an annual basis, the historic series of seasonally adjusted data are revised in light of the most recent information on changes in seasonality."

5,"From August 9, 2020 to September 25, 2021, Employment and Social Development Canada applied a minimum unemployment rate of 13.1% for Employment Insurance (EI) economic regions with an unemployment rate lower than 13.1%; regions with a higher unemployment rate kept their actual rate. The unemployment rates for the relevant effective periods reflect this change."
6,"As a result of a temporary measure in effect from April 6, 2025 to July 12, 2025, the unemployment rates are adjusted by one percentage point (to a maximum of 13.1%) in all Employment Insurance (EI) economic regions, ensuring that no region has an unemployment rate less than 7.1%. Regions with an unemployment rate of 13.1% or higher keep their actual rate.

7,"The boundaries of these regions are determined by Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC).

8,"Prince Edward Island as well as the territories are each comprised of two regions effective October 12, 2014."
9,"The monthly regional unemployment rates for EI purposes in the territories are subject to the greater of a seasonally adjusted three-month moving average or 12-month moving average."
10,"This region excludes St. John's."
11,"This region excludes Charlottetown."
12,"This region excludes Whitehorse."
13,"This region excludes Yellowknife."
14,"This region excludes Iqaluit."
